it is a really good phone for daily tasks the cameras are great 48mp photos are very sharp and detailed you can relay on this phone for 5 years i have other apple products and the ecosystem is also great everything works seamlessly   for those who are switching from android battery life is good in this phone but compared to my previous phone which had 4500mah battery i have to charge this phone 2 times in a day almost after limiting the battery to 80  overall it is a great phone the video quality is great  if you want an android alternative then you can buy s24 or s23 and if you want batter backup and ios then go for plus model,camera,positive,0

overall the iphone 15 is a fantastic phone for everyday use it offers a compelling blend of performance camera prowess no doubt the best camera and battery life as per my use it is easily lasting 1 full day however the lack of a high refresh rate display and the underwhelming charging speed hold it back from being truly exceptional  pros superb cameras the 48mp main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and dynamic range lowlight performance is also impressive and the video output is so amazing a16 bionic chip blazingfast performance handles demanding tasks and games effortlessly improved design the new matte finish and rounded edges feel fantastic in hand making it a comfortable phone to use finally usbc ditching the lightning port is a welcome change but the lack of usb 32 speeds is disappointing allday battery life easily lasts a full day on a single charge with normal usage  cons 60hz display competitors offer smoother 120hz displays at this price point making the iphone 15 feel dated in comparison slow charging takes significantly longer to charge compared to other flagships  additional notes this review is based on my personal experience using the iphone 15 for the past 1 month your experience may vary depending on your individual usage patterns and preferences be sure to consider your needs and budget before making a purchase decision,design,positive,0

the only thing i like about this phone is the camera quality and that is the reason i bought this phone i already have an android phone which is less than 50 of its price and still is better in every aspect except the camera well definitely iphone 15 has a flagship level chipset but i am not a gamer and a normal user and i find mid rangers and flagship all perform at similar level in daily tasks while iphone 15 only has 60hz screen which feels choppy all other phones have 120144hz screen which are smooth af ios itself feels like its missing so many features and unnecessarily extra steps are required to do tasks which are totally simplified in android  battery life is decent charging is fine nothing to complain camera is great in outdoor situation and video recording if you are not into camera why are you even buying this phone just go and buy android phones,battery,positive,0

a mixed bag of brilliance  the iphone 15 flaunts an impressive camera setup capturing moments with exceptional clarity and detail however users may encounter heating issues post 80 charge which could disrupt prolonged usage occasionally screen touch glitches may hamper the otherwise seamless user experience despite these setbacks the iphone 15 excels in performance and features the standout dynamic island feature enhances productivity and personalization overall the iphone 15 is a commendable upgrade marred by minor hiccups if you prioritize camera quality and innovative features its still a worthy investment,performance,positive,0

upgraded from samsung m21 to this and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process samsung has really refined the smart switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one  the phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery it feels top notch premium and performs buttery smooth note its slippery as it has glass on both sides so its a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes  the camera is stellar and both the photos and videos are exceptional the screen is crisp and smooth and feels very responsive the battery life may need more testing cant say much   overall a superb deal at 38k for the 256gb model,camera,positive,0

liked the product as expected from a samsung device it has a brilliant display and camera the performance is great too phone is fast and snappy what i didnt like is the battery performance its fairly decent my 3 yr old oneplus 9r was giving similar batter life a difference of max 1520 mins screen on time charging could be faster too expected at least a 45w capacity but still not a deal breaker another point is fingerprint sensor doesnt work properly with a screen guard i didnt know this was a thing because it never happened to me while using oneplus devices  update  i also notice heating issues while video calling not expected from a flagship device to be honest definitely happening because of the exynos chip hoping improvements with upcoming updates  overall looks  910 battery  710 display  1010 performance  810 camera  910,battery,positive,1

a mixed bag of brilliance  the iphone 15 flaunts an impressive camera setup capturing moments with exceptional clarity and detail however users may encounter heating issues post 80 charge which could disrupt prolonged usage occasionally screen touch glitches may hamper the otherwise seamless user experience despite these setbacks the iphone 15 excels in performance and features the standout dynamic island feature enhances productivity and personalization overall the iphone 15 is a commendable upgrade marred by minor hiccups if you prioritize camera quality and innovative features its still a worthy investment,camera,positive,1
overall the iphone 15 is a fantastic phone for everyday use it offers a compelling blend of performance camera prowess no doubt the best camera and battery life as per my use it is easily lasting 1 full day however the lack of a high refresh rate display and the underwhelming charging speed hold it back from being truly exceptional  pros superb cameras the 48mp main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and dynamic range lowlight performance is also impressive and the video output is so amazing a16 bionic chip blazingfast performance handles demanding tasks and games effortlessly improved design the new matte finish and rounded edges feel fantastic in hand making it a comfortable phone to use finally usbc ditching the lightning port is a welcome change but the lack of usb 32 speeds is disappointing allday battery life easily lasts a full day on a single charge with normal usage  cons 60hz display competitors offer smoother 120hz displays at this price point making the iphone 15 feel dated in comparison slow charging takes significantly longer to charge compared to other flagships  additional notes this review is based on my personal experience using the iphone 15 for the past 1 month your experience may vary depending on your individual usage patterns and preferences be sure to consider your needs and budget before making a purchase decision,battery,positive,1
awesome experience entering the apple ecosystem below are some of the pros and cons  pros 2 camera is awesome and clicks good photos even in daylight and night 3 size is perfect and easy to handle 4 apple ecosystem is the best 5 battery charging rate is good and not too slow and battery backup is also lasting 1 day for a normal usage 6 dynamic island is the best upgrade from 14 7 texture and phone build quality has improved a lot  cons 1 sometimes phone gets heated but that is manageable  2 of course we have to purchase charger cover nd temper glass which is costly,battery,positive,1

design  i liked the curved look with soft back side the free protective back case doesnt cover the curved sides of the screen even the screen gaurd lasted just 1 month since it didnt cover the edges of the screen it started to peel off i also liked that this phone has very few bloatware  battery  awesome charging speed 0 to 100 in 125 hrs at moderate usage 3 to 4 hrs of usage per day with calls and browsing no games it lasts upto 2 days  display  very good clarity  rear camera  awesome photos in low lightpoor light conditions daylight photos good but could have had more realistic colors  front camera  good it has a nice feature to capture photos with gestures  speaker  loud enough though both the top and bottom speakers are claimed to be used when phone is tilted horizontally i wasnt impressed,camera,positive,1

after a threemonth of using and evaluation the camera and display performance are commendable the battery capacity is satisfactory with a combination of cpu from exynos 2400 and gpu from amd super fast it is advised to refrain from using cheap inbuilt magsafe back covers as they may drain all your battery power,battery,positive,1

upgraded from samsung m21 to this and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process samsung has really refined the smart switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one  the phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery it feels top notch premium and performs buttery smooth note its slippery as it has glass on both sides so its a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes  the camera is stellar and both the photos and videos are exceptional the screen is crisp and smooth and feels very responsive the battery life may need more testing cant say much   overall a superb deal at 38k for the 256gb model,battery,positive,1

overall the iphone 15 is a fantastic phone for everyday use it offers a compelling blend of performance camera prowess no doubt the best camera and battery life as per my use it is easily lasting 1 full day however the lack of a high refresh rate display and the underwhelming charging speed hold it back from being truly exceptional  pros superb cameras the 48mp main sensor captures stunning photos with excellent detail and dynamic range lowlight performance is also impressive and the video output is so amazing a16 bionic chip blazingfast performance handles demanding tasks and games effortlessly improved design the new matte finish and rounded edges feel fantastic in hand making it a comfortable phone to use finally usbc ditching the lightning port is a welcome change but the lack of usb 32 speeds is disappointing allday battery life easily lasts a full day on a single charge with normal usage  cons 60hz display competitors offer smoother 120hz displays at this price point making the iphone 15 feel dated in comparison slow charging takes significantly longer to charge compared to other flagships  additional notes this review is based on my personal experience using the iphone 15 for the past 1 month your experience may vary depending on your individual usage patterns and preferences be sure to consider your needs and budget before making a purchase decision,camera,positive,2
it is a really good phone for daily tasks the cameras are great 48mp photos are very sharp and detailed you can relay on this phone for 5 years i have other apple products and the ecosystem is also great everything works seamlessly   for those who are switching from android battery life is good in this phone but compared to my previous phone which had 4500mah battery i have to charge this phone 2 times in a day almost after limiting the battery to 80  overall it is a great phone the video quality is great  if you want an android alternative then you can buy s24 or s23 and if you want batter backup and ios then go for plus model,battery,positive,2

liked the product as expected from a samsung device it has a brilliant display and camera the performance is great too phone is fast and snappy what i didnt like is the battery performance its fairly decent my 3 yr old oneplus 9r was giving similar batter life a difference of max 1520 mins screen on time charging could be faster too expected at least a 45w capacity but still not a deal breaker another point is fingerprint sensor doesnt work properly with a screen guard i didnt know this was a thing because it never happened to me while using oneplus devices  update  i also notice heating issues while video calling not expected from a flagship device to be honest definitely happening because of the exynos chip hoping improvements with upcoming updates  overall looks  910 battery  710 display  1010 performance  810 camera  910,performance,positive,2

product is really good but sometimes it gets so hot specially while charging and while using camera but on still its performance is not affected by heating os no doubt is the best performance is fast and well optimised specially app opening gaming and while doing normal tasks battery performance also good you can use one whole day while performing normal tasks and while gaming you will get 5 hours of battery backup  camera no doubt is the best specially for video shooting captures more details and natural coloursdisplay quality also good  and overall experience is much better than androids,performance,positive,2
the only thing i like about this phone is the camera quality and that is the reason i bought this phone i already have an android phone which is less than 50 of its price and still is better in every aspect except the camera well definitely iphone 15 has a flagship level chipset but i am not a gamer and a normal user and i find mid rangers and flagship all perform at similar level in daily tasks while iphone 15 only has 60hz screen which feels choppy all other phones have 120144hz screen which are smooth af ios itself feels like its missing so many features and unnecessarily extra steps are required to do tasks which are totally simplified in android  battery life is decent charging is fine nothing to complain camera is great in outdoor situation and video recording if you are not into camera why are you even buying this phone just go and buy android phones,camera,positive,3
